    "bio": "Hi there, I am Danial Zulhakim bin Norazman! You might also know me as Danial. I start to explore about coding from 2020 until now. As a new website developer, I'm trying to learn something new to improve my knowledge about coding everyday. Along the journey I realised my passion existed in developing website and I want to pursue my dreams as upcoming developers. With this passion, I hope one day I can be a trainer who trained thousand's of new developers across the globe and I will apply my developing skills in a range of cool builds and challenges.",
